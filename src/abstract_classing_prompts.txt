# Scene State
# Receives pre-processed data objects from Input Bus
# Contains
# Spacial simulator accepts input from Spatial Data assemblage 

#  // CLIP or similar image-to-text should be invoked to produce tokens from video along with OCR

# Tokenized Sentiment Assembly accepts input from tokenized image, OCR or text file data
